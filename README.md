<h1>Game Pets</h1>

<h3>Game is simple game where you select your pet and give your name. Once you enter the game, you have to accumulate enough money, lives from the selected choices.
Whenever you choose food for your pet there are effects that are loaded or removed until you win or lose the game.</h3>

<h4>For this app I use C# and Xaml.</h4>
